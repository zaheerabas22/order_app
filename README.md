Order App
Overview
This Flutter project, "order_app," serves as an order management application with a focus on user-friendly functionalities and a professional UI design. Here's a comprehensive overview of what the project includes:

State Management: Utilized GetX for efficient state management throughout the application.

UI Design: Designed the UI to be professional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to specific color schemes defined in AppColors. Implemented layouts using Flutter widgets such as Column, Row, ListView, Stack, etc.

API Integration: Integrated API to fetch product data dynamically for seamless user interaction.

Quality Code: Ensured the codebase is clean, well-maintained, and adequately documented for easy comprehension and future development.

Responsiveness: Designed the UI to be responsive across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Product List/Table: Implemented a dynamic product entry table where users can input product details including 'Product Name' and 'Quantity'. Users can add as many rows as needed using a floating action button.

Autocomplete: Integrated an autocomplete feature for the 'Product Name' field, allowing users to quickly select products from a dynamically fetched list or manually enter product names.

Dynamic Button States: Implemented dynamic button states, specifically for the 'arrow forward' icon, which navigates users to the next screen. The button is enabled only when at least one row in the product table is filled.

Add Notes and Images: Enabled functionality where users can add notes and select images for each product row. Implemented a modal that opens on long-pressing or double-tapping a row with product data, displaying icons indicating the presence of notes, images, or both.
